# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 30, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:\
I've learnt Python basics and I also solved several Python basic challenge from Hackerrank. After some learning, I create a Simple Calculator program and Rock Paper Scissor program.

**Thoughts**\
I've started coding again after a long time and I feel great that I can solve problems and coding something. I look forward to the next day (challenge)!
